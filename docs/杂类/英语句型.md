# 英语句型

## 基本句型一：主+谓+宾

### 简介

主语 + 谓语 + 宾语

> My father is a teacher.

宾语可以省略，只剩下 主语 + 谓语。

> It rains.

主语可以是从句。

> That the earth is round is true.

### 谓语

谓语分成两种情况。

（1）谓语是主语发出的动作。

某些情况可能存在双宾语。动作的直接对象称为直接宾语，间接对象称为间接宾语。

> She lent me her car.

上面示例中，her car 是 lent 的直接对象，因此是直接宾语，me 则是间接宾语。

如果间接宾语在直接宾语后面，两者之间需要添加介词，通常是 to。

> She gave a pencil to me.

（2）谓语是主语的某种性质。

这种情况下，谓语称为系动词，宾语是补语（complement）。

> She is sad.
> She seems happy.
> He became a policeman.

### 宾语

疑问词（what、when、who 等）可以用作宾语。

> I want to know how to bake a cake.
> Tell me what to wear.
> Tell me where to buy tickets.
> She told me when to take my medicine.

谓语是感官动词（see、hear、fell 等）时，修饰宾语的动词不动式可以省略 to。

>  I saw him cry.
>  I heard you scream.
>  I felt the car shake.

使役动词也是类似用法。

> I had her do her homework.
> Mother made me wash the dishes.
## 状语

状语是对谓语的修饰。

> A little dog sleeps on the door mat.

副词可以充当状语。

> All of a sudden, she fell down.

状语如果是单个词，也称为补语。

> That made them sad.
> They elected him class leader.
## 复杂句

### 宾语从句

> I lost the umbrella which I bought yesterday.

宾语从句可以直接充当宾语。

> I think that she is polite.
### 状语从句

使用从句，增加状语成分。

> She is a student although she looks like a teacher.
> My little sister will cry if she is hungry.

### 主语从句

> The woman who sat on this sofa is Mary.
